			<h3>Weekly Reflections</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Week 1</li>
				<p>
					Week one has been about settling in and getting a sense of the boot-camp. For me, I had the added challenge of settling in a
					new city. The big takeaway for me from week 1 is that I have to do lots of work outside class, perhaps more than I will do in class.

				<li>Week 2</li>
			</ul>
